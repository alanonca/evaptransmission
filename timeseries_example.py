# timeseries.three(df[pandas dataframe], maxOffset[int], stationaryTest[bool]=True, trainTestSplit[bool]=True, 
# 	splitLastxRows[int]=4, forecastDays[int]=10)

# More explanation of the parameters:
# Vector autoregression of 3 timeseries: settling time, viability and daily new cases percentage increase
# 	each being a column in df
# The model determines the dependence of new cases percentage increase on a particular day using data of all
# 	3 columns from the day before to 'maxOffset' days before as the dependent variables
# stationaryTest checks whether data in each column is staionary which is a prerequisite to do this regression
# 	analysis. If set True the result is printed in command line, if set False test is not preformed
# trainTestSplit splits all rows into a training dataset and a testing dataset if set True, and the last 
# 	'splitLastxRows' rows will be set as the testing dataset, the rest as training dataset. If set False, 
# 	all data will be used as training data
# splitLastxRows is the number of rows put into the testing dataset. This variable is only used if trainTestSplit=True
# forecastDays is the number of days to forecast into the future using all current data as training dataset, 
# 	this vairable is only used if trainTestSplit=False

# Split original data into training and test dataset and see if model predicts known data well

# Use all data as training data and forecast into the future
